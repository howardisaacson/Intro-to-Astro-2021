To break that down, turboSETI looks for very narrow frequency bands (~a few Hz) that contain anomalously high powers throughout an observation. It is even capable of following these signals if they drift off of their original frequency due to relative accelerations between the receiver on Earth and the transmitter out in space (very likely, as radial accelerations are *everywhere* in the universe). Finding these narrow signals would be exciting, because there's no astrophysical phenomenon that we know of that can get to bandwidths smaller than ~kHz (and those are radio masers, which are a very interesting topic in their own right). Not only that, but these very narrow signals are how we communicate to each other via GPS, cell signals, etc. on Earth! \n",

Then, in the next file, we \"moved the telescope\" to an off-source position, or a random part of the sky far away from the primary target, and observed there for the same amount of time. We repeat that \"on-off\" pattern two more times. The idea is that any narrowband radio frequency interference (RFI) will appear no matter where the telescope is pointing, in both the on and the off observations, because it's coming from somewhere nearby on the surface of the Earth. BUT any actual signal generated by that position on the sky will only appear when we're pointed at the on-source.

Each frequency channel in this data product is about ~3 Hz wide, which is way narrower than what people would normally use for astronomy research. Remember, this is because we're looking for signals which we expect to be way narrower than what would be produced by nature!

But exactly how high of a power is \"anomalous\"? And how big of a drift do we want the code to allow? **You, as the scientist, need to make that decision!** But I can give you some details, and some guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximum Drift Rate**: This parameter defines the largest \"slopes\", positive and negative, you want `turboSETI` to search in the data, and is measured in Hz/s. A signal with zero drift rate is likely RFI, and will appear as a vertical line in a \"dynamic spectrum\" or \"waterfall plot\" of the data. Signals with higher drift rates will appear as lines with greater and greater slopes. ~6 Hz/s used to be the standard value chosen for data at these frequencies (6 GHz or in the middle of so-called \"C-band\"). Breakthrough Listen tends to do ~4X this. But known M-dwarf exoplanetary systems could produce drifts of up to hundreds of Hz/s due to their extremely tight, high-acceleration orbits! What should you choose? I would recommend to start small and work your way up - with this algorithm, searching 2X as many drift rates will take 2X as long!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: This parameter is probably the one which you're a little more familiar with - the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gives a measure of the strength of a signal compared to the surrounding noise. Instrumental effects and statistical fluctuations produce a noise background that's mostly quiet, but has occasional strong spikes - we want to set our SNR high enough that we don't catch these false positives! The bigger problem, however, is RFI. The lower we set our SNR, the more random Earth-transmitters the algorithm will find. If you don't set your threshold high enough, you'll end up producing hundreds (or thousands! or millions!) of plots of RFI, and you won't be able to visually inspect them all for the needle-in-the-haystack SETI signal. BUT the higher you set your SNR, the more likely that you'll accidentally throw the real signal out - just because a signal is real doesn't mean it will be bright! The standard SNR choice in SETI searches is 10. BL has talked about using 5, which I'm doing for my current project. If you are finding that you're producing too many plots at the end of the notebook, a good way to fix that is to raise this value.\n",
