# Making a Curriculum Vitae #
by: Isabel Angelo (2018) 

For this week's assignment, we are going to create our own academic curriculum vitae, or CV. 

### But first: what is LaTeX?
LaTeX is a formatting language that is commonly used to create scientific documents for publication. We write our text in LaTeX 
so that we can control the way the text is formatted and presented. To read more about LaTex, visit The LATEX project:
https://www.latex-project.org/

For our tutorial, we will use a LaTex text editor called overleaf. Overleaf is a website that provides LaTeX templates 
to edit yourself. This makes it user-friendly and a great introduction to learning LaTeX.

**Step 1:**
Make an account on overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/).

**Step 2:** 
Select the Resume/CV template that you would like to use.

**Step 3:** 
Edit the source text/LaTeX code on the left side of the template with your information to create your own personal CV!

### What goes in a CV?

A Curriculum Vitae, or an academic resume, serves to summarize your accomplishments in a compact format that is used for job interviews, grant proposals, tends to be of general interst to people who want to connect with you in academia. Categories can vary depending on your specific qualifications, but there are some common categories that go in most academic CV's. There are others that are common but not mandatory, and are meant to highlight the unique skills and experience of the individual.

**common categories:** education, research experience, honors and awards, publications, posters/talks/conferences attended, teaching/volunteer work/outreach, coursework, technical skills (the last two are less common post-undergrad, but are super helpful for applying to more entry-level research positions)

**other optional categories:** research interests, observing experience and/or high performance computing experience, languages, extracurriculars, references, news/media (if your research is talked about in an article, if you have a blog, etc), or any category that can highlight a skill you have

**categories that don't belong:** date of birth, citizenship, address, non-academic work experience, extracurricular activities (sports teams, clubs, etc.), volunteer experience (unless is is related to your academic field, in which case it can go under "outreach")

*note: if you don't have anything to fill out for some of these categories, don't worry! They are a good thing to keep in mind for the future, but are by no means necessary for starting research. These categories can take years (often an entire undergraduate career) to build up*
 
### How should a research project be described?
You want to make this part concise but still highlight your accomplishments. A description of a research project should include the following:

(1) your position title and institution

(2) name of your advisor(s)

(3) basic mission of the research

(4) final output (publication, poster, presentation, written code, etc.)

you may also want to describe any major skills you used (adapting code for supercomputer, developing MCMC, etc.)

### General Tips for Making a Good CV

*1. Keep a list of things you want to add to it.* When you think of something that can go on your CV, write it down in a notebook or in a note on your phone. Then when you go to update your CV, you won't have to rack your brain for what to put on it. It's amazing how much this helps!

*2. Look at other CV's for examples.* Go onto websites of people in your field and look at their CV's (see this week's README  for examples). This can give you ideas for what categories to use and what a good CV can look like.

*3. Put your best accomplishments at the top!* Most of the time education and research are the first categories in a CV, but after that it is more open-ended. If you are particularly proud of your teaching experience or awards, don't be afraid to put that where the reader can see it.
