Assignment: If you haven't already, write your CV in LaTeX to take it to the next level. Check out
the many CV templates at https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv. You can also Google around for
templates others have scattered across the internet.

Additionally, select a template to use for your final project writeup. Some great examples can be
found here:
