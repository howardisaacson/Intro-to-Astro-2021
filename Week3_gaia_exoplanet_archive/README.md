# Agenda:

### Howard: Intro
- Check-in. 
### Imposter Syndrome 
- Article [here](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/health-fitness/medical-conditions/what-is-impostor-syndrome).
### Writing Exercise: 
In your online notebooks, please spend 10 minutes responding to the following prompts:

    1. Write down everything you learned from reading this week's scientific paper. Focus on two categories: 
    - general lessons about effectively reading science papers
    - things you learned about exoplanet science and astronomy
    
    2. What paper-reading tactics worked effectively last week? What will you do differently when reading this week's paper?
    
### Tutorials:
1. Alma: NASA Exoplanet Archive
2. Sarah: Gaia Database

# Assignments:

1. Complete Alma's NASA Exoplanet Archive jupyter notebook.

2. Complete Sarah's Gaia Database jupyter notebook.

3. a) Use these python tutorials to help you with Alma's and Sarah's tutorials, but focus on 1. and 2. first.
This of 2b and 2c as references for the above tutorials.

3b [python/matplotlib tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html)  (move to week 2)

3c [python/pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) (move to different week)

4.  (Bonus Round!) 
   This tutorial has many very useful routines. If you have completed the first two tutorials,
   try this one next. [week 3 python tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) 

5.  Finish reading the week 2 [scientific paper of the week](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2960.pdf). Remember, if you haven't already, post at least two questions about the paper on piazza and answer at least one classmate's question (you don't have to be right)!

6. Post one question you have about Gaia on piazza.
