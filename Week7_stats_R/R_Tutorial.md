## R & Rstudio Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will:
- learn about R and the integrated development environment (IDE), Rstudio
- use a pre-generated script to generate results
- analyze the growth rate of bacterial organisms

## Before the tutorial
- Download Anaconda-Navigator for your operating system and install Rstudio using the following in command line:
> conda install anaconda-navigator

> conda install rstudio

## Use R to analyze bacterial growth rates
- Download (or do a git pull for) the growth_rates.R script provided in Week 7 of the class GitHub page
- Vary the time (year=n) by 1, 10, 30, 50, and 100 years
- Vary the initial population size (n=n) by 1, 10, 30, 50, and 100 individuals
- Vary the environmental carrying capacity by 100, 1000, and 10000

## Analysis
For any one of your runs, compute the following:
1. Mean growth rate over time
2. Maximum growth rate
3. Minimum growth rate
4. Mode of the growth rate over time
5. Median of the growth rate over time

Note, you have not been provided the code or taught the commands to perform these calculations. So, you must look up appropriate commands yourself and write the code. Good luck!

## Discussion
In your Google Drive notebook, upload your plots and answer the following questions:
1. How does the time-scale affect the population size over time?
2. How does initial population size affect the population size over time?
3. How does the environmental carrying capacity affect the population size over time? The final population size?

## Note to instructor 
The guided tutorial part of this lesson includes a screen share of the instructors Rstudio app, 
while defining key terms in the provided script and explaining key differences between python and R.
