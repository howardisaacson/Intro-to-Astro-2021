# How to Read Scientific Papers

by Isabel Angelo & Sarah Blunt (2018, updated 2019)

In this introduction, we suggest some techniques for effectively reading a scientific paper. We also provide resources that are commonly used in astronomy to make finding, reading, and storing papers much easier.

## Finding Scientific Papers:
Use the Astrophysics Data System or ADS:

https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu

ADS is a database where journal articles in astrophysics are stored. You can query the database by typing in the author, title, or other relevant information about a paper. The search engine will return a list of matches to your search, from which you can find the paper you are looking for.

## Downloading and Storing Papers:
Mendeley is a great application to track the many scientific papers that you will use throughout your careers.

Mendeley allows you to download papers and keep them stored in a single, organized library on your own computer. You can also sort papers into cetegories and annotate them (similar to google docs) so you can have notes, definitions, etc. on-hand.

## Closely Reading science papers:

For your assignment this week, please read the paper of the week thoroughly. Try to observe the following note-taking strategy (or use something similar that works for you!):

Highlight words you don't know in one color. Look up their definitions and write them down as in-text notes as you read.
Highlight key ideas in another color.
Keep a general note with summaries of each paragraph
Keep a general note with summaries of each section
Keep a note with 10-word or less summaries of each figure
Keep a note with overall questions you have about the paper. Some of these you may resolve as you read-- once you've finished reading the paper, revisit this note and see how many of your own questions you can answer!
